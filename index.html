                <h2>Boulder: Rock Mecca </h2>
                <p>Boulder is a small city of approximately 100,000, 40 minutes northwest of Denver, blessed with an amazing amount of rocks with decent variety of rock type for cragging minutes from downtown. Tucked at the base of the The Flatirons this
                    picturesque community is convenient for climbers and has attracted more than its share of our vertically oriented community. Its youthful presence of students at the University of Colorado, CU attracts a better than average selection
                    of restaurants and shops to satisfy your non-climbing needs.</p>

                <p>For rock type, you can find granite, solid Fountain Formation sandstone, Dakota sandstone, quartzite, and even some gneiss or schist for your vertical adventures. A bit further afield you can find basalt, conglomerate, even limestone.
                    For climbing styles, you can find routes from boulder problems to 700 foot vertical crags to 2300 foot slabbing adventures from highballs to bolted sport climbs to mind-challenging traditional lines. You can even climb in the rain.
                    You can play on crowded rock or find nearly untraveled stone. You can even seek out occasional ice or mixed climbs. For seasons, you can find something to climb virtually any day of the year, depending upon your climbing style or tolerances
                    to weather.
                </p>

                <p>At one point in history, some might argue that the rocks around this town were a focal point for the advancement of American climbing. Still, these crags are rich with history. Today, with perhaps the exception of the high-end climber,
                    nearly every climber can find something nearby to satisfy their climbing desires. </p>
